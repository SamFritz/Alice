               <l>&#160; &#160; &#160;Full leisurely we glide;</l>
               <l>For both our oars, with little skill,</l>
               <l>&#160; &#160; &#160;By little arms are plied,</l>

                  story was begun took place in 1862. She is seven in Alice’s Adventures in
                  Wonderland, which is set in May; and seven and a half in Through the

               <l>In gentler tones Secunda hopes </l>

               <l>The dream-child moving through a land </l>
               <l>&#160; &#160; &#160;Of wonders wild and new, </l>
               <l>In friendly chat with bird or beast— </l>
               <l>&#160; &#160; &#160;And half believe it true. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And ever, as the story drained </l>
               <l>&#160; &#160; &#160;The wells of fancy dry, </l>
               <l>And faintly strove that weary one </l>

               <l>Its quaint events were hammered out— </l>

            <head>Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit Hole</head>
            <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of
               having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was
               reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, <q>and what is the use of a
                  book,</q> thought Alice, <q>without pictures or conversations?</q></p>
            <p>So she was considering, in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made
               her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would
               be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
               Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. </p>
            <p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so <hi
                  rend="italics">very</hi> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself
                  <q>Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!</q> (when she thought it over afterwards
               it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all
               seemed quite natural); but, when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of it
               waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet,
               for it</p>
            <pb n="7"/>
            <p>flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either
               waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran
               across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large
               rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
            <p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considered how in the world
               she was to get out again. </p>
            <p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly
               down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before
               she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.</p>
            <p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as
               she went down to look about her, and to wonder what was going to happen next. First,
               she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to
               see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were
               filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there she saw maps and pictures hung
               upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed: it was labeled
                  <hi rend="italics" style="bold">“ORANGE MARMALADE,”</hi> but to her great
               disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for fear of killing
               somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past
               it. </p>
            <p><q>Well!</q> thought Alice to herself. <q>After such a fall as this, I shall think
                  nothing of tumbling down-stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I
                  wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell of the top of the house!</q>(Which
               was very likely true.)</p>
            <p>Down, down, down. Would the fall <hi rend="italics">never</hi> come to an end? <q>I
                  wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?</q> she said aloud. <q>I must be
                  getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
                  thousand miles down, I think—</q> (for, you see, Alice had learnt several thinks
               of this sort in her lessons in the school-room, and although this was not a <hi
                  rend="italics">very</hi> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there
               was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) <q>—yes,
                  that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve
                  go to?</q> (Alice had not the slightest idea what Latitude was, or Longitude
               either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say.)</p>
            <p>Presently she began again. <q>I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How
                  funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads
                  downwards! The antipathies, I think—</q> (she was rather glad there was no one
               listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) <q>—but I shall have
                  to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this
                  New</q></p>
            <pb n="8"/>
            <p><q>Zealand? Or Australia?</q>(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy,<hi
                  rend="italics">curtseying</hi> as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you
               could manage it?) <q>And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking!
                  Not, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.</q></p>
            <p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again.
                  <q>Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!</q> (Dinah was the
                  cat.<note>Dinah was also the name of the Liddell’s cat, named, with her companion
                  Villikens, after the character in a popular mid century dialect ballad</note>)
                  <q>I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish
                  you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’, afraid, but you
                  might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I
                  wonder?</q> And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to
               herself, in a dreamy fort of way, <q>Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?</q> and
               sometimes <q>Do bats eat cats?</q> for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either
               question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing
               off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and
               was saying to her, very earnestly, <q>Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat
                  a bat?</q> when suddenly, thump! Thump! Down she came upon a heap of sticks and
               dry leaves, and the fall was over. </p>
            <p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked
               up, but it was all dark overhead: before her was another long passage, and the White
               Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away
               went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner,
                  <q>Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!</q> She was close behind it
               when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
               herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the
               roof.</p>
            <p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had
               been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly
               down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. </p>
            <p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass: there
               was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first idea was that his might
               belong to one of the doors of the hall; but alas! either the locks were too large, or
               the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the
               second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind
               it was a little door about fifteen </p>
            <pb n="9"/>
           <p>inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it
               fitted!</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger
               than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest
               garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about
               among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not event
               get her head through the doorway; <q>and even if my head <hi rend="italics"
                     >would</hi> go thought,</q> thought poor Alice, <q>“it would be of very little
                  use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think
                  I could, if I only knew how to begin.</q> For, you see, so many out-of-the-way
               things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed
               were really impossible. </p>
            <p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the
               table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules
               for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it
                  (<q>which certainly was not here before,</q> said Alice), and tied around the neck
               of the bottle was a paper label, with the words <hi rend="italics">“DRINK ME”</hi>
               beautifully printed on it in large letters. </p>
            <p>It was all very well to say <hi rend="italics">“Drink me,”</hi> but the wise little
               Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. <q>No, I’ll look first,</q> she said,
                  <q>“and see whether it’s marked <hi rend="italics">‘poison’</hi> or not</q>; for
               she had read several nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten
               up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember
               the simple rules their friends had taught</p>
            <pb n="10"/>
            <p>them:<note>This reference is a traditional kind of children’s story, popular in the
                  late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries but beginning to seem old-fashioned
                  by the time Dodgson told the Alice stories, in which clear lessons of obedience
                  and prudence were enforced by visiting terrible calamities upon children who
                  transgressed. Dodgson placed asterisks after the paragraphs in which Alice drinks
                  the contents of the bottle and, later in this chapter and again in chapter 5, east
                  the cake, in order to emphasize the abrupt changes characteristics of the
                  strangely ordered experience of Wonderland</note> such as, that a red-hot poker
               will burn you if you hold it too long; and that, if you cut your finger <hi
                  rend="italics">very</hi> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never
               forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain
               to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p>
            <p>However, this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and,
               finding it very nice (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart,
               custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast), she very soon
               finished it off. </p>
            <p><q>What a curious feeling!</q> said Alice. <q>I must be shutting up like a
                  telescope!</q> And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her
               face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through
               the little door into that lovely garden. First, how-</p>
            <pb n="11"/>
            <p>ever, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she
               felt a little nervous about this; <q>for it might end, you know,</q> said Alice to
               herself, <q>in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like
                  then?</q> And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle looks like after the
               candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p>
            <p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the
               garden at once but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the door, she found she
               could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through, the glass, and
               she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
               and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and
               cried.</p>
            <p><q>Come, there’s no use in crying like that!</q> said Alice to herself rather
               sharply. <q>I advise you to leave off this minute!</q> She general gave herself very
               good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself
               so severely as to bring tears into her eye; and once she remembered trying to box her
               own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against
               herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. <q>But
                  it’s no use now,</q> thought poor Alice, <q>to pretend to be two people! Why,
                  there’s hardly enough of me left to make <hi rend="italics">one</hi> respectable
                  person!</q></p>
            <p>Soon her eyes fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened
               it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words <hi rend="italics">“EAT
                  ME”</hi> were beautifully marked in currants. <q>Well, I’ll eat it,</q> said
               Alice, <q>and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me
                  grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I’ll get into the garden,
                  and I don’t care which happens!</q></p>
            <p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself <q>Which way? Which way?</q>,
               holding her hand on the top of her head to heel which way it was growing; and she was
               quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. To be sure, this is what
               generally happened when on eats cake; but Alice had got so much into the way of
               expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and
               stupid for life to go on in the common way</p>
            <p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>
